Install the apk in your smartphone.

To configure the ip in the apk , open the apk with a java supported editor, preferably in VS-Code or Android Studio.

Inside MainActivity.java, edit the line **s = new Socket("192.168.43.231",6000);** instead of ip -192.168.43.231 , you can use your own Ip Address.
