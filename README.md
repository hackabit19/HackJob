Title: Golfie

Idea is to build a simulation game, based on the game of golf. And to use a normal selfie stick with a mobile phone attached at the end as a golf club, so as to give a realistic experience of playing actual golf. The player will be able to replicate the motion of hitting a ball with the club, using the selfie stick. A screen will show the complete golf pitch, where the ball will be shown as being hit with the same force with which the player swings the selfie stick. 

How does it work?

The phone acts as a controller, which connects to the game running on the desktop by the means of sockets, through which the accelerometer and gyroscope data is sent to the server made on the desktop. This data is used to move the golf stick in the game. The game is made in unity and the scripting of the game is done in C#.
